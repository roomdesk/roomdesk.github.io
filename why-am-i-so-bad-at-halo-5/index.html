Having been with players since the beginning of the franchise with the original halo in 2001, players came to treat cortana as a sidekick, rather than just a voice in your head giving you commands. Everything in halo 5 has to be designed to work around. No single part of it was bad, but none of it felt like it wasn�t decided by committee and churned out to fill a quota. I found the aiming to be very good on halo 5 which was a 60 fps game but i also found the aiming to be pretty good on halo 4 which was 30 fps so i don�t understand why it feels so bad on halo infinite?

<p>What i said earlier in this post — how i feel about how cortana looks in the opening cutscene for halo 5 — applies to how cortana looks throughout the rest. Then i took awhile off and played other games for awhile, not sure how long, but now i am so terrible. Everything in halo 5 has to be designed to work around. I�ve played halo since the original came out on xbox.</p>

<p>Why halo reach is bad as a person that has played halo since halo 1 and played competitively since halo 2 and placed well at mlg evets and won money playing halo, yes, in my opinion halo reach is a joke.

<p>Be aware of how much you�re sprinting/thrusting. Sadly, it�s the only success in what is otherwise probably the worst mainline halo to date. Halo fans aren�t unadapatable the things you pointed out, sprinting, ads, and movement abilities, are largely viewed as a negative because they clash with map and gameplay ideologies.

<p>Everything in halo 5 has to be designed to work around. In halo 5 he doesn’t seem serious at all, he’s literally just nathan fillion in mjolnir. You need to get a feel for when the right amount of shield damage is, but this is important to learn. Good article praising silent, stoic heroes like Master.</p>

<p>In halo 5, cortana is evil now because “reasons.” we’ll have to wait until halo 6 (at least) in order to know exactly why. Guardians needs to leave cortana in the past. I first started on halo 3 when it first came out. Mega Construx.</p>
