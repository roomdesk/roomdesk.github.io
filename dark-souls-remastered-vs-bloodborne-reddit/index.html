<p>The biggest difference between souls and nioh is in the world design rather than level design. The series is great, like others said ds3 is most similar to bloodborne, but ds remastered is also great. Dark souls remastered vs original hi just wondering if i should get dark souls for ps3, prepare to die edition for pc or the remaster for pc. Bb sucks a ton of dick.</p>
