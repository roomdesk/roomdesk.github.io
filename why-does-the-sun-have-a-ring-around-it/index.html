Does a ring around the moon mean rain is coming soon From science.howstuffworks.com
The rainbow around the sun spiritual meaning depends on the cultures all around. They get this name because the ring is located 22 degrees away from the sun itself. It is called a halo and these are very common when we have high cirrus clouds in the atmosphere. Both the sun and the moon block a 1/2 degree region of the sky at a time, so the ring around the sun is about 44.
