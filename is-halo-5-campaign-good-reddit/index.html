The future of gaming is lonely (and online only) The Verge From theverge.com
Halo 5 has a bunch of different moves (such as sprint, spartan charge, ground pound, thrust) which make halo 5 fall under the category of advanced movement. Overall, halo 5 is a comfortably better game then halo 4, but still far behind the highpoints of combat evolved and reach. Halo has always been good to me. Upon release, halo 5 received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise directed at its gameplay, visuals, level design and multiplayer modes.

<p>This one was actually really tough for me because largely, i think halo 4 ‘s campaign is pretty darn good. The campaign is enjoyable, especially if you enjoyed 4. Halo 5’s campaign was a bit less reliant on external media, really only needing it for the backstories of the different spartans in fireteam osiris and blue team.
