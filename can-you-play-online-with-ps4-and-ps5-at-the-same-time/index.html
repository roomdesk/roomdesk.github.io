<p>However if your playing a game on ps4 using your account you can�t then play a ps4 game on ps5 (found this out as my brother is playing on our account on the ps4 and i have just gone to play a ps4 game on ps5 and no luck i have to suspend his game of which he don�t want me to do obviously) Your brother has to make an account and keep yours primary on the ps4. One thing they say is while you can be signed into the same account on the ps4 and ps5, once you start a game/app on one it would stop you on the other system. Its pretty easy to do.</p>
