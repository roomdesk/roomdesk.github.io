The Good, the Bad and the Ugly of the Halo 5 Guardians From hardcoregamer.com
Yeah, the article does seem like a troll article. As a halo fan for nearly 15 years, i didn�t want to have to write this. I�m not the biggest halo fan but i use to have a blast on 3 and reach back in the day. Halo 4 had a great campaign (at least from a writing perspective) but pretty bad multiplayer.

<p>It makes me sad to say, but halo 5 is definitely the worst halo game of all. It is the most simplistic and dumbed down campaign in the series.
