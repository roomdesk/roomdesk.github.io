Master Chief (Halo) Alchetron, The Free Social Encyclopedia From alchetron.com
Normal people live to be around 77. If you are talking talking about pre blessing doom guy, probably the chief but keep in mind that even then, the doom guy was capable of beating ip a dozen argenta fighters, who would have thrived on a planet with stronger gravity than that if. In his teen years, he received a series of injections that augmented his physical capabilities to above and beyond what any normal human would ever be. In halo infinite we saw atriox badly defeat the master chief during their raid on unsc infinity.

<p>Initially, developers at bungie kept the master chief�s physical characteristics and personality as secret as possible. And as should be established by now, i love the halo series. In halo lore, master chief is a human with genetic enhancements. I know halo the flood has some of that, as well as other books i’ve read, but i would love to have something closer to what we have in halo silent storm and oblivion, where the entire story has something to do with the chief, and yet we got to hear more about what they (the covenant) think of him.</p>
