However, there is another type of optical phenomenon that’s commonly classified as a sun halo, and that’s the light pillar, or sun pillar. Halos around the sun or moon are caused by high, thin cirrus clouds drifting high above your head. Halos are caused by cirrus clouds. Recall that the atmosphere is a mix of gases , including oxygen, nitrogen and water vapor.

<p>Veiling glare results from glistening formation in the iol. The icy crystals that cause them form in high altitude clouds 5 km or so above earth�s surface where it is always freezing, says bruce wielicki, an atmospheric scientist at nasa�s langley research center. (see ww2010�s website for diagrams that illustrate how it works.) Cataracts commonly cause halos and glare.</p>

<p>Most halos appear as bright white rings but in some instances, the dispersion of light as it passes through ice crystals found in upper level cirrus clouds can cause a halo to have color. A mix of chemistry, physics and geometry are the main components for sun halos.

<p>Halos (pictured) are the result of the refraction or bending of sunlight or moonlight by thin, high, icy cirrus clouds. What we see in the image to the right is a full moon, surrounded by a colourful halo, with the constellation scorpius faintly visible along the top border. Where the halos are formed? What Causes a Halo Around the Sun?.</p>
<h3 id="a-halo-is-a-ring-of-light-surrounding-the-sun-or-moon">A Halo Is A Ring Of Light Surrounding The Sun Or Moon.</h3><p>They form at specific distances from the sun (due to the angles of the crystal, and the degree to which it bends light). These clouds appear at altitudes above 20,000 feet, where air temperatures are always below freezing, even during the middle of the summer. Ice crystals in the atmosphere create glowing spots on both sides of the sun, called sundogs. The cirrus and cirrostratus clouds which cause the halos often signal a frontal system on the horizon.</p>
<h3 id="see-ww2010039s-website-for-diagrams-that-illustrate-how-it-works">(See Ww2010�S Website For Diagrams That Illustrate How It Works.)</h3><p>They do it by refracting and reflecting the light. Halos (pictured) are the result of the refraction or bending of sunlight or moonlight by thin, high, icy cirrus clouds. Many of these appear near the sun or moon, but others occur elsewhere or even in the opposite part of the sky. Conditions that can cause this include:</p>
<h3 id="if-light-cant-focus-on-it-you-may-start-to-see-halos-or-glare">If Light Can’t Focus On It, You May Start To See Halos Or Glare.</h3><p>The icy crystals that cause them form in high altitude clouds 5 km or so above earth�s surface where it is always freezing, says bruce wielicki, an atmospheric scientist at nasa�s langley research center. Look for sun pillars when the sun is. It takes the form of a ring with a radius of approximately 22 degrees around the sun or the moon. The halos are caused by refraction, or splitting of light, and also by reflection, or glints of light from hexagonal ice crystals, he said, adding that the phenomenon works on the principle of a kaleidoscope.</p>
