Me and my gf are very into terraria but i’m on xbox and she’s on switch, so just wondering if we would ever be able to play together without one of us buying a new console. With the final update to terraria coming in 2020, we expect that it will stay this way. Can players cross play terraria? I wanna know if there will ever be cross platform play, specifically ps4 and pc.
