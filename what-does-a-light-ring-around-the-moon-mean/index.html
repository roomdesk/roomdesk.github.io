<p>This phenomenon is called a “moon halo.” according to the national weather service, this ring of light, which is actually an optical illusion, forms around the moon when moonlight refracts off ice crystals in cirrus clouds, high up in the earth’s atmosphere. It is the result of the moon�s light being refracted by ice crystals in cirrus clouds in the upper troposphere at an altitude of approximately 6000 meters (20 000 feet). The ring, or a lunar halo, is caused by the refraction and reflection of light from ice crystals that are suspended in thin, wispy, cirrus or cirrostratus clouds that are at high altitudes.
