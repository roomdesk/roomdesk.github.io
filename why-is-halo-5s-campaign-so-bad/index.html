A lot of people who defend halo 5 try to say that the marketing for all of the halo games were hardly reflective of the final product. Why is halo 5�s campaign so bad!? The halo 5 campaign wasn�t written by the same people who wrote halo 4, and it shows badly. Halo 5�s story and campaign were not well received by most people, but the mp was good, however they made a mistake of launching the mp with missing gametypes, which again is now corrected.

<p>I know this might be considered cheating, but it still technically says �halo 3� in the title so it counts. The world will never be the same. Halo 4 is it good or bad. “halo 5’s story was so bad, it should be used as an example as to how not to write a story” this here, is his main argument.</p>

<p>The graphics were amazing and by far the best looking game i�ve seen in a while. Halo 4, despite its glaring gameplay flaws, managed to deliver one of halo�s best stories.

<p>I personally love halo 4�s story, and halo 5�s is just so underwhelming. That’s true to an extent, but 343 made the mistake of directly linking hunt the truth and at least the hunter+hunted trailers and bullet teaser along with other major media released prior to halo 5.

<p>The library is the only genuinely bad level.

<p>One of the biggest surprises to come to the halo universe, and the only game to change up the halo formula in a meaningful way, was halo 3: The end result was a 30 second slap fight before locke was ready to risk everything for chief and chief was never remotely close to being portrayed as a traitor.

<p>Why is halo 5�s campaign so bad!? The ad campaign proposed something very different. Personally i really like the heavier emphasis on the books, but they could definitely benefit by providing a short introduction to things for people that don’t want to read a dozen novels to understand the story of their new.

The library is the only genuinely bad level. I know this might be considered cheating, but it still technically says �halo 3� in the title so it counts. Why is halo 5�s campaign so bad!?</p>

Halo 5�s story and campaign were not well received by most people, but the mp was good, however they made a mistake of launching the mp with missing gametypes, which again is now corrected. As a good sequel should. Halo 5’s campaign was a bit less reliant on external media, really only needing it for the backstories of the different spartans in fireteam osiris and blue team.</p>
