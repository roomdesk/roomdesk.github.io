Halo 4 Master Chief�s Face Revealed WikiGameGuides From youtube.com
A good place to practice is the flood game types (as flood). Why is halo 4 so good? I still don�t understand how they managed to get it to look so good at that hardware.

Interestingly, if a player utilizes both the stealth upgrade and hologram ability, their hologram will still display bright orange while the player is blue, allowing alert players to differentiate between the two.

<p>I know that developers manage to squeeze a surprising amount of power out of the machines in its final years, but imo halo 4 is on a whole other level. I don’t think it’s 343’s worst game, but after the excellent reach title update &amp; ce anniversary remaster, halo 4 was an extreme disappointment that didn’t live up to any hype.
