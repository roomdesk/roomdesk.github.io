Is Keyboard &amp; Mouse Really Better Than Controller From youtube.com
The skill it would take a mouse and keyboard user to compete with an above average controller player is insane. You know it, i know it, but that doesn’t mean. This is generally the main reason why someone would choose the keyboard and mouse over the controller. Last night was the first time i played with an xbox controller and i really do not want to be biased towards a mouse and keyboard setup for pc, but i had such a bad experience with that controller.

<p>At longer ranges, controllers are inferior to a connected mouse even with the aim assist function. A controller isn’t as precise or fast as a keyboard and mouse, but it’s far more comfortable, and it makes up for the lack of precision with a little bit of assistance when it comes to lining up shots. My friends who never played halo play with a controller and do very well. CONTROLLER OR KEYBOARD AND MOUSE? WHICH ONE IS BETTER.</p>

<p>(halo mcc pc) watch later. But when i started playing infinite it was on pc with mnk and i heard the aim assist on the controller was meta so i tried it and it does seems to be pretty good so i played for awhile like that but i tried going back to mnk and i actually think in most cases the mnk accuracy at range is much better than controller. The mouse has a lot more sensitivity, allowing for skilled players to hit flicks and other kinds of complex shots. Fall Guys Xbox One Controller vs Mouse and Keyboard.</p>

<p>Consoles don�t suck for fps games, it just takes practice. You can look up the controller aim assist range and bullet magnetism angles and see that it only works in close to medium range encounters, with the angle changing based on that as well. I was more interested on the general thoughts between the differences for mouse and keyboard vs controller on halo specifically. Why Controller Is Better Than Keyboard And Mouse.</p>

It all comes down to infinite�s strafe speed, close quarters combat, and importance placed on the br / sidekick / commando. Most people will perform better on controller because of the aim assist which is what people are doing currently on mcc pc. This is generally the main reason why someone would choose the keyboard and mouse over the controller.</p>
<h3 id="mk-have-controller-beat-in-a-couple-areas">M+K Have Controller Beat In A Couple Areas:</h3><p>I am autistic and find fine motor skills hard, and trying to get things setup on my mouse and try to keep the games simple on the keyboard. Both have advantages over the other. I feel like the only reason controllers have an advantage is mainly due to people having been playing halo on them for years and years, whereas most people have only been playing halo with kbm for like. Aiming down sights, vehicle control and shooting, and long range engagements.</p>
<h3 id="so-im-playing-on-pc-although-i-play-console-games-too">So Im Playing On Pc Although I Play Console Games Too.</h3><p>You know it, i know it, but that doesn’t mean. The skill it would take a mouse and keyboard user to compete with an above average controller player is insane. So i’ve been playing halo on my pc with keyboard and mouse and to be honest it seems like controller may be better for some odd reason. A controller isn’t as precise or fast as a keyboard and mouse, but it’s far more comfortable, and it makes up for the lack of precision with a little bit of assistance when it comes to lining up shots.</p>

A mouse and keyboard can be far superior if you can take the time to learn. Purely because i feel more than any other game there is a clear consistent advantage for controller, where it doesn’t matter how good you can be on keyboard, you still don’t have favourable odds to out play someone in multiplayer. You can look up the controller aim assist range and bullet magnetism angles and see that it only works in close to medium range encounters, with the angle changing based on that as well.</p>
