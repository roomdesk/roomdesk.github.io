Halo Infinite delayed to 2021, will miss Xbox Series X From tweaktown.com
Halo infinite supports 120 fps on the xbox series x, and it used to support the same on xbox series s too, but the final network test might have dropped it. While we don’t have our video, check out the dynamic backgrounds in action through a video shared by the verge’s tom warren. 343 is the worst xbox game studio, they have always delivered disappointments. Halo 5, and mcc look great and appear to have similar graphics quality, but the resolution is a massive downgrade for infinite.
