From Tracie Ring Around The Sun From fromtracie.com
A sun halo, a circle of light that creates a circle 22° wide around the sun, is a related phenomenon. These halos are always a perfect circle, but you may not always see the full circle if clouds are in the way. Thin cirrus clouds generally form around 20,000 feet or higher. A halo is a ring or light that forms around the sun or moon as the sun or moon light refracts off ice crystals present in a thin veil of cirrus clouds.
