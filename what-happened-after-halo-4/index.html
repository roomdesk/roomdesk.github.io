I have googled little bits of info here and there, but it still leaves some gaps in the story for me. What Happened to The Didact AFTER Halo 4 (and How He Might.</p>

A lot of new and old characters seem to have made their way into the latest game.

Afaik, the best sources of info (again, not in touch with halo) would be the cutscene at the end of halo 3 and quite possibly the teasers for halo 4.</p>
<h3 id="odst-will-be-us5-though">Odst Will Be $Us5, Though.</h3><p>You don�t mess with john. Show activity on this post.

In an official halo comic details are revealed about what happens after halo 4, including news on the arbiter. Master chief and cortana are pitted against the forerunner known as the didact, as well as a splinter faction of the covenant. Now one thing that i always wondered after playing halo;</p>
