78�s do sound the best, in theory. In fact, neither of those cases are “better”. Coloured vinyl isnt specially manufactured for records like the black vinyl is and this is the reason for lesser quality. Digital audiophiles should get remastered albums from hd tracks, where the ardent and skillful work of engineers like katz can be appreciated, and sometimes sound superior to vinyl.

<p>Sure, you might prefer the warm analog sound, specifically its crackling and other imperfections, as well as the visceral experience of actually dropping the needle on a spinning record, but cds are simply the best sounding physical audio. Vinyl�s capable of a lot, but only if the grooves are wide enough for the needle to track them properly.
