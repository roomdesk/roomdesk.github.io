Halos around lights are caused by diffraction, or bending of the light entering your eye. Seeing halos around lights could mean that you’re developing a serious eye disorder such as cataracts or glaucoma. A halo is an optical phenomenon produced by light interacting with ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. However, there is another type of optical phenomenon that’s commonly classified as a sun halo, and that’s the light pillar, or sun pillar.
