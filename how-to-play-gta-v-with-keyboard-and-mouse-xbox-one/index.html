Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5) Premium Edition Xbox One From alzashop.com
Seems like the more serious pc gamers are using keyboard and mouse for this game. Can you use laptop keyboard for xbox one? Lol, it�s actually much easier and more precise to control the vehicles with the analog sticks and throttles on a game controller (i�m using xbox one wired), i still use mouse/keys for walking/shooting/aiming of cause, because it�s far better/more accurate to. I like playing with both the keyboard and mouse and the xbox one controller.
