It started with older headlights being selective yellow and as others have said, was kept on race cars so it’s easier to tell what type of vehicle is behind you. Phoenix racing/james finch didn’t get financial backing from any of the auto manufacturers so for the longest time he refused to put any sort of decals until about 2002 when ford ponied up some money for the 09 car. So is my brother but he still needs headlights. Selective yellow was mandatory until 1993 in france, and with france’s history in endurance racing it certainly makes sense.

<p>Bmw’s reasoning for bringing yellow headlights back relates directly to their endurance racing car, the m8 gte, which has yellow headlights. They also have brakes in their cars but using them can be a little more difficult than just hammering on the brakes in a pit stop. Certain series� run on fully lit tracks, nascar for example, and the lights would be pointless (another point here, the lights on a nascar track would be useless due to the banking). Why did france have yellow headlights ?</p>

<p>One key reason for this is to protect other drivers on the track.if a car got into a crash during a race with real headlights, the glass would likely break causing debris to cover the track and could lead to even more damage by puncturing other car�s tires.
