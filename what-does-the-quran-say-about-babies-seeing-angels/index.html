<meta name="description" content="Review Of What Does The Quran Say About Babies Seeing Angels References, The quran tells that the angels glorify and praise god, and believe in him, and they ask forgiveness for those who believe and repent [40.7] and appeal to god to admit them into paradise and the righteous among their parents, spouses, and children [40.8] and protect them from falling into sin on judgment day [40.9]. At fajr time, the angels move around to listen to your prayer and thus the hen/rooster sees the angels and crows which will wake you up to pray.
