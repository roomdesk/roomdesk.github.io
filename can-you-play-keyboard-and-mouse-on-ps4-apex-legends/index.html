Apex Legends Can you play Apex with MOUSE and KEYBOARD on From youtube.com
Best thing about console apex legends is youcan�t play it with mouse and keyboard.finally, another game that doesn�t support mouse andkeyboard on console. If you want to play ps4 games with a keyboard and mouse there aren’t many options, unless you opt for the hori tactical assault commander pro, or an adapter. It’s not just a lot of keys in a row. I have never used them but i know they exist.
