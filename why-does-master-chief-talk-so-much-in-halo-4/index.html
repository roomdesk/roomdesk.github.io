In halo 4 john needed to speak more so he could take control of situations cortana couldn�t. To expand on this, the jiralhanae had recently started a rebellion on sanghelios so jul felt they couldn�t be trusted. Sure you can do it again but with a new villain and better technology, but in the end the story will end the same way, with chief doing what he always does and saving humanity, at great sacrifice. Basically, many sangheili disapprove of the friendship between thel vadam (arby) and humanity.

<p>Steam is releasing these games over time, with an anticipated release for halo 4 in 2020. It starts with the chief walkiing past spartan sarah palmer, and you get to see how tall he is in comparison to her.

<p>Master chief talks considerably more in halo 4 than in prior games, which is interesting, because he’s traditionally this stoic, faceless protagonist — the “empty vessel” into which you’re supposed to pour yourself. Whether he�s called master chief, john, or simply sir, the man in the spartan armor throughout the halo saga works best as one of few words.
