Vinyl Records VS. CDs Vs. Streaming, Which Sounds Better From retroonly.com
Vinyl records sound better than cds because they don’t experience a conversion like a compact disc. If you have a vinyl that’s truly well reproduced (hey, contact us if you need vinyl record pressing in la), the sound is more acoustic and live as if you’re in a real space. This is because too compressed and amplified audio when the record is cut makes such kind of a groove on the record that the needle may fall out of the groove. The cd can handle more signal manipulation than the record.

<p>And many people prefer vinyl�s sound. I must admit when cd�s first hit the market back in the 80�s they churned out loads of older material on the format and they did a pretty bad rush job of it all just to make money, there was no way 99% of that stuff churned out back then sounded better than the original vinyl albums i already had, and they sounded pretty naff in comparison to them, but the newer. As an audiophile who was always swapping and changing record decks, arms and cartridges in the 80s, i can confidently confirm that cds now produce a far greater undistorted level of sound than i ever managed to achieve with vinyl. In most cases, vinyl’s frequency range is lower than that of cds.</p>
