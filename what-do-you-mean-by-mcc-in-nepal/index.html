The crimes of KP Oli should reach the people Madhav Nepal From himalsanchar.com
Nepal assuaged india’s concern by telling its leaders that projects under the bri would be limited to connectivity and hydropower and would not affect india’s security. This is standard for any international agreement or treaty. The successful implementation of mcc could give a positive message in bringing more fdi in nepal. Rejecting bri and going on with mcc alone means that we remain sort of disconnected from the chinese economy and increase reliance on the big bullying brother of the south.
