How To GTA V Prologue PC Keyboard Mouse YouTube From youtube.com
Just wondering what other people like to use when playing gta on the pc! I use a ps3 pad but will probably grab something like a ps4 or xb1 pad soon. I played gta iv with kb &amp; m with no problem at all and played gta v on ps3 so if the driving hold up on keyboard and mouse you shouldn�t have no problem. However, i seriously doubt that you’ll be able to use mouse and keyboard for gta v on the xbox due to it most likely not having support for it.
