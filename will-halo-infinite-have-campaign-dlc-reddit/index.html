<p>Halo infinite job posting hints at seasonal story dlc &amp; f2p updates. If this is true, we�ll certainly be pretty hyped. As it is one of the most requested things, and is all over reddit, they should roll out the campaign roadmap at the next community update, but i doubt it. Nicholas Simonovski.</p>

<p>Personally i think i’d be both an idiotic decision and a huge missed opportunity for 343 not to give us campaign dlc. No matter what, though, we wouldn�t expect to see this potential story dlc any time soon. I believe there won�t be pre load for the halo infinite campaign, because it is treated/handled as dlc in the game files and i don�t think you could ever pre load dlc on xbox consoles. 343i promises to fix Halo 5�s aiming while announcing new.</p>
