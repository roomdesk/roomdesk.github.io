<p>Take care when photographing halos if the unshielded sun is in the field of view. Camera flashes can leave temporary images in your vision, called flash blindness. If the halo is followed by high, thin, wispy cirrus clouds, then there is a storm system approaching you. It’s possible for your eyes to become sunburned if they’re exposed to too much of the sun’s ultraviolet (uv) light.</p>

<p>While the beautiful sight may complement the springtime weather, the sun halo is not limited to a certain season and can happen anytime, anywhere, depending on the viewer�s vantage point and the sun�s position. Occasionally, brighter areas will form along these halos, creating a mock sun, or “sundog.” sundogs are known as parhelia (or the singular parhelion) to astronomers, from the greek words meaning “beside the sun.” When you’re looking for halos, or rings around the sun, make sure you always shield both eyes from the sun.

<p>Krause is quick to point out that these halos and arcs aren�t a harbinger of dangerous weather. A halo is a ring or light that forms around the sun or moon as the sun or moon light refracts off ice crystals present in a thin veil of cirrus clouds. The prism effect is such that the rainbow colors go from red on the inside to violet on the outside. How to take great weather photos Social Media Blog.</p>
