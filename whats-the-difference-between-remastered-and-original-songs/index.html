Can you tell the difference between a Star Trek episode From metv.com
When music is remastered, flaws present in the original recording (like bad edits, microphone noises, hiss) are removed. Sadly that�s missing in the 2014 version. Other examples include the upcoming medievil, system shock 2, and command &amp; conquer remakes. Rs 2014 remastered is better in nearly every way, however, there is a quaintness or feel to the original rs that i like.
