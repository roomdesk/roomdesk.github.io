Metro Redux review The definitive way to play Metro 2033 From pcworld.com
For me this game is good not because of any one specific thing. Both games are remastered and they both feel exactly the same metro redux is the best definition of how a remaster of a game should be. Last light is a decent game, but i love 2033! On top of that, 4a games had added so much content you’d almost forget you’re ‘merely’ dealing with a remake.

<p>Very good game, not with a few flaws. Overall the game delivers a pretty good story (not too shabby or predictable) with good graphics and game play, so its not generic. One way that it could have been improved would have been. Frankly as a game exodus isnt as good as metro 2033 or metro last light.</p>
