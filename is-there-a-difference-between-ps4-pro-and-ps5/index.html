PS4 Vs PS5 Which One to Buy and What To Expect From tweaklibrary.com
The “ps5 vs ps4 pro” debate has been going on for a while now. In addition, there�s absolutely nothing else on the ps5 that i would play besides gran turismo 7 that isn�t already on other platforms, so the ps4 version it is; And observing from the previous generations of ps and their pro versions, there might a bit of hardware upgrade, but it. Yes the ps4 pro was not useless at all and i expect things ti be even more interesting in ps5 pro since it won’t be just a clock speed boost and extra cus but multisoc architecture so the results will be even more fascinating.
