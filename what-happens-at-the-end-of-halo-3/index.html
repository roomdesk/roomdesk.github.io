<p>He lands on the forerunner planet (halo legends) Halo odst is a predecessor to halo 3, so it happens at an earlier date where does master chief land at the end of halo 3?

At the end of halo reach, if you fail to destroy the covenant cruiser, it will glass the whole area including the pillar of autumn. And it the reach trailer, the moon is in the same spot.
