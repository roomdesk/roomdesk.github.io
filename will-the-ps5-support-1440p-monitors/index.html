<p>By myles wong published nov 10, 2020. Despite sony saying that the playstation wouldn�t support 1440p, new evidence suggests that it is possible to make it work on a 1440p monitor. G7 accepts 4k input and downscales it to 1440p. Been playing all my ps5 games on a 1440p monitor as well, and it�d be really nice if sony could support this resolution.</p>

<p>Dont buy it for ps5. Upscaling can work well if the pixels are upscaling by an integer (2x from 1080p to 2160p) as opposed to a fraction/decimal (1.5x in the case of 1080p to 1440p). The ps5 currently doesn’t support 1440p resolution due to sony having focused on tv displays. PS5 1440P QHD Monitor Test Sceptre 35 Inch Curved.</p>

<p>That’s at least according to twitter axel, who connected a 1440p display with hdmi 2.0 to the ps5, with the console’s.

<p>Ps5 doesn’t support 1440p due to tvs taking priority over monitors. Mine has a hdmi2.0 port so can output 1080p at 120hz or i can set it to 4k and output 1440p but then only get 60hz.

<p>Lots of assumption below that the ps5 will output at 1440p/144hz. Will ps5 1440p actually ever exist?

<p>The playstation 5 doesn�t have native support for 1440p resolutions, and a sony manager says that�s because the company is prioritizing tvs. Mine has a hdmi2.0 port so can output 1080p at 120hz or i can set it to 4k and output 1440p but then only get 60hz.

<p>The press release also provides a list of gaming monitors that will be able to use this �console mode� to display ps5 1440p resolution. Upscaling can work well if the pixels are upscaling by an integer (2x from 1080p to 2160p) as opposed to a fraction/decimal (1.5x in the case of 1080p to 1440p). 1080p or 4k 144hz if you can afford it.

<p>Lots of assumption below that the ps5 will output at 1440p/144hz. Mine has a hdmi2.0 port so can output 1080p at 120hz or i can set it to 4k and output 1440p but then only get 60hz. As for the ultrawide/21:9 screen format, the console and monitor collaborate on taking a 1920 x 1080 image (which is much smaller than 3440 x 1440) and intelligently scale it up to fill the screen.

<p>The ps5 currently doesn’t support 1440p resolution due to sony having focused on tv displays. While the ps5 is not officially able to display a native 1440p for supported monitors, it’s recently emerged that sony’s new console can be tricked into accepting a 4k signal on select devices. The playstation 5 doesn�t have native support for 1440p resolutions, and a sony manager says that�s because the company is prioritizing tvs. The PS5 Doesn�t Support 1440p Now, But That Could Change.</p>

I use a 1440p 144hz monitor with a ps5. It�s also worth noting that many of the existing 1440p120hz+ monitors only output 120hz over displayport, with hdmi being capped at 100hz (lg 27gl850 for example). 1080p or 4k 144hz if you can afford it.</p>
