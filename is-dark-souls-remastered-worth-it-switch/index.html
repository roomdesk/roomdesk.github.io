Prepare To Die In Dark Souls Remastered On Nintendo From nintendo-insider.com
It�s alright when compared to remastered imo but disappointing compared to the prepare to die edition of dark souls. If it was $60 like most of the nintendo games, it wouldnt be worth the price. The only armors not worth upgrading (at least to max) are the ones that require standard titanite. Love it or hate it, it is what it is.
