<p>The minor prophet is the reason he couldn�t effectively deal with both the unsc and the flood, contradicting his orders and overriding his authority for militarily bad decisions, but he died when the truth and reconciliation was captured by major silva�s helljumpers, so there�s no other figure senior enough to blame.

The government is an imperfect arbiter of a person’s inner thoughts, and the attempt to punish some thoughts more than actions can lead to tyranny. Primus hoped that dominating him would fix him.
