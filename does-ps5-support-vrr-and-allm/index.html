PlayStation 5 Keine Anzeichen für VRR, ALLM, 8K oder From 4kfilme.de
The best ps5/series x tv picks on a budget Hdmi 2.1 supports three very attractive features for those who own ps5 and xbox series x consoles. Sony are currently working on vrr and allm firmware updates for their ready for ps5 x900h / xh90 4k tv, so once those updates are finally released, i�d guess the ps5 vrr update probably won�t be far behind. Ps5 hardware supports variable refresh rate (vrr) through hdmi 2.1.

<p>As spotted by hdtv test, the company has begun rolling out a new firmware update in china that enables variable refresh rate ( vrr) support and an automatic low latency mode (allm) to its 2020. Sony are currently working on vrr and allm firmware updates for their ready for ps5 x900h / xh90 4k tv, so once those updates are finally released, i�d guess the ps5 vrr update probably won�t be far behind.
