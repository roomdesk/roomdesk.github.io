<h3 id="and-do-first-pressings-sound-better">And, “Do First Pressings Sound Better?”.</h3><p>Hence, record labels have found it to be a means by which loyal fans can buy their favourite albums again. Vinyl has definitely made a small comeback. Also if you have a top notch digital playback system or very good analog playback system it�s also. “maybe the first time, it was mastered for a cd but poorly and now they want to get it right,” says katz.</p>
