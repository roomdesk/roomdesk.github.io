<p>However, xbox one does not support bluetooth devices. I just purchased my first ever xbox one and my first game call of the wild. My suggestion is to try using a regular xbox one controller (any should do, standard, elite series 1 or 2) to turn on the console, launch the game, then turn off the controller, and connect the keyboard and mouse after the controller has been turned off, you should then be prompted to select an account to use the keyboard and mouse with for the game. I believe using a keyboard and mouse would be better (right?).</p>
