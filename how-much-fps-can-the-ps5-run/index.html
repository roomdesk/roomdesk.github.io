Whats Gonna Be Better Xbox Series X Or Ps5 GELOMAI From gelomai.blogspot.com
As a tradeoff, players can select a lower frame rate for their gameplay instead of focusing on resolution. However, enabling 120 fps on fortnite ps5 comes with some compromises like resolution capping and reduction of some graphics settings. If they are planning on making the ps5 hit the 4k 60fps benchmark then without a doubt it should be able to run 1080p and at the very least 120fps but id love to see 144fps.
