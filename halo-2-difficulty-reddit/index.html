The master chief collection &gt; general discussions &gt; topic details. Halo 2�s development was a mess, and they completely goofed the balance for difficulty on the harder difficulties. Anyways i�ve looked in several places and don�t see how to change the difficulty to a lower one. Any problem you�ll run into on legendary, most of them you�ll run into on heroic.
