Tiny ice crystals in earth’s atmosphere create the halos. Moon halos are usually seen as a bright, white ring, although sometimes they can have color, appearing like faint rainbows.</p>

It is the result of the moon�s light being refracted by ice crystals in cirrus clouds in the upper troposphere at an altitude of approximately 6000 meters (20 000 feet). The sound of their barks creates a ring around the moon at night. A lunar halo is caused by the refraction, reflection, and dispersion of light through ice particles suspended within thin, wispy, high altitude cirrus or cirrostratus clouds.</p>
<h3 id="tiny-ice-crystals-in-earths-atmosphere-create-the-halos">Tiny Ice Crystals In Earth’s Atmosphere Create The Halos.</h3><p>The ice crystals responsible for the formation of halos are always suspended in cirrus in the upper troposphere. Halos around the sun or moon happen when high, thin cirrus clouds are drifting high above your head. If you do see a halo around the moon or sun, notice that the inner edge is sharp, while the outer edge is more diffuse. Halos around the sun or moon are caused by high, thin cirrus clouds drifting high above your head.</p>
<h3 id="everyone-sees-their-own-particular">Everyone Sees Their Own Particular.</h3><p>Similar halos are also sometimes seen around the sun. One example is that of “halos” around the moon caused by tiny ice crystals in the upper atmosphere refracting light from the moon. A halo is an optical phenomenon produced by light (typically from the sun or moon) interacting with ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. Tiny ice crystals in earth’s atmosphere create the halos.</p>
