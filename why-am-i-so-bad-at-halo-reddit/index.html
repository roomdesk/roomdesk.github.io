<p>It took exactly one match of halo infinite multiplayer (which surprise released earlier this week) to remember just how different halo is from every other multiplayer shooter out. It�s making the game really really unfun. Over the weekend a post blew up on reddit asking the question “why do people run up and twerk over me when i die at halo infinite?”.the accompanying image shows one spartan squatting perfectly over the dead body of an enemy player, showing respect in death the only way halo players know how. This is a subreddit for a discord bot, not memes.</p>
