The name covenant is just because nobody really differenciated between the species in the covenant and the word became a name for all species (grunts, elites, jackals.) a normal person would not really care for the difference. In halo 4, the grunts and elites speak the same language. Why the Arbiter looks different in halo 5 Halo Universe.</p>

<p>No one on either side knew how to properly converse with the mgalekgolo; You can hear the grunts call you this when they spot you or any marines in halo 4. The elites in halo 4 and 5 not only look different, they also look ugly as hell. Question about the different Sangheili designs HaloStory.</p>

<p>If their elite commander is killed, covenant grunts and jackals will panic and flee from the player. Most did, in fact, side with the elites, as the elites treated them with respect (as you would to a 12ft mound of screaming death) and the hunters actually respected the elites, whereas the brutes openly disliked them and the feeling was mutual. In halo 3 , the third and fourth players in cooperative mode play as two new elite characters, nï¿½tho ï¿½sraom and usze ï¿½taham. Can Elites have customization for armors too? Halo 5.</p>

<p>It is clear that at some point in halo 5 we will work side by side with the arbiter again and will more than likely have a few of his elites on our team.

<p>No one on either side knew how to properly converse with the mgalekgolo; Halo 4 multiplayer was too similar to cod. Both mainly due to them wanting the covenant to be more alien and foreign. I want to help 343 get back on track for fans! Halo 5.</p>

<p>And the elites themselves look very top heavy and no longer as agile as. Both mainly due to them wanting the covenant to be more alien and foreign. The difference of languages is due to artistic decisions by both 343i and bungie. Bring back old elites in Halo 2! Halo The Master Chief.</p>

<p>Some pros of halo 4 were. 343 gave almost everything in halo 4 a new look to make it their own. In halo 4, the grunts and elites speak the same language. Halo 4 Elite Wallpaper (76+ images).</p>
<h3 id="my-biggest-problems-with-this-are-the-elites-and-spartansquotethings-like-the-jackals-are-ok">My Biggest Problems With This Are The Elites And Spartans.[/Quote]Things Like The Jackals Are Ok.</h3><p>What is with the changes to the eliteï¿½s. This is for reasons of time and resources and does not indicate a visual. While master chiefï¿½s mjolnir armor makes him taller than grunts and jackals at 7 feet 2, elites still have him beat. From the looks of it these storm elite may as well be a subspecies.</p>
<h3 id="and-you-put-their-eyes-basically-inside-their-mandibles">And You Put Their Eyes Basically Inside Their Mandibles.</h3><p>The campaign had a good story. The difference of languages is due to artistic decisions by both 343i and bungie. With halo 4 and from what iï¿½ve seen from halo 5, the helmets are much wider, almost bulbous. That doesnât mean that this isnât just a new look.</p>
<h3 id="it039s-not-a-look-befitting-of-the-elites-at-all">Itï¿½s Not A Look Befitting Of The Elites At All.</h3><p>Fighting the covenant is fun because thereï¿½s a variety in the makeup of their forces, how their armed, and how they complement one another. 343 gave almost everything in halo 4 a new look to make it their own. Theyï¿½ve lost their aerodynamic look in their suits. The prometheans were like two or three different units in halo 4, mostly armed the same way, who move and act in predictable ways.</p>
<h3 id="it-wasnt-a-colossal-failure">It Wasnt A Colossal Failure.</h3><p>I always pretend they are different subspecies in each game. In halo 4, grunts and elites are changed byt they look the same as their origional discription, just with storm armor. Guardians, all sangheili are depicted as similar to the phenotype introduced in halo 4. Basically, the original covenant is disbanded.</p>
