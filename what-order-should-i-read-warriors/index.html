<p>Tallstar�s revenge is an e…. I would suggest starting in order from the very first book into the wild. You read the series in order, and their not called original series, the super editions, and novellas fit in when you are reading a book related to it, like when you are reading the book when firestar saves skyclan you could also read firestar’s quest as well but i’m my recommendation you just do the order of the series and lastly read the special editions and novellas, Warrior Cats Super Editions List All Things About Pets.</p>
