GameStop�s 2014 Black Friday Deals Have Leaked Kotaku From kotaku.com.au
Gamestop does not do repairs. So if you think you might want to go back to play some of your ps3 or xbox 360 games, it�s probably best to hold onto those consoles until there�s further news about backward compatibility support. If they don�t take ps3s, or 360s without the sticker then they won�t take the xbox one without it either. You are not going to get them to let you have a new ps3 or even an old one for your xbox 360 or vice verse.
