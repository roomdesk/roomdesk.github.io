<p>Itï¿½s fine to prefer keyboard and mouse, no shade, but 343 needs to be careful how they introduce keyboard and mouse to a series that has been controller based for 12 years. Itâs specifically the âflinchâ mechanic that auto adjusts controller playersâ aim towards their opponents head, every time they shoot or get shot. Mcc will soon join gears 5, sea of thieves, and more in the growing list of xbox one games that support mouse and keyboard input on the console, as well as crossplay with pc players.

<p>There is no kbm support for mcc on console. Using keyboard and mouse on a game which already has heavy aim assist to help you (because everyone should be using a controller) is very much cheating. When coupled with the standard âsticky aimâ of aim assist (which is normal for all controller shooters), itâs pretty ridiculously overpowered.

<p>Keyboard and mouse is a native part of halo: Well i play on pc, but i play mcc with a xbox controller because playing halo for years i simply cannot get used to playing mouse and keyboard online ( i can handle it in single player) it would be like me playing tekken or mk or dark souls on a keyboard. Ah yes the people whoï¿½ve been playing halo for more than 10 years on a controller will suddenly ï¿½ï¿½suckï¿½ï¿½ againï¿½t a dude with a keyboard and mouse , bruh youï¿½re up to some actual â¥â¥â¥â¥ when this game launches lmao.
