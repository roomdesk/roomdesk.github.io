<p>It�s fine to prefer keyboard and mouse, no shade, but 343 needs to be careful how they introduce keyboard and mouse to a series that has been controller based for 12 years. It’s specifically the “flinch” mechanic that auto adjusts controller players’ aim towards their opponents head, every time they shoot or get shot. Mcc will soon join gears 5, sea of thieves, and more in the growing list of xbox one games that support mouse and keyboard input on the console, as well as crossplay with pc players.

<p>There is no kbm support for mcc on console. Using keyboard and mouse on a game which already has heavy aim assist to help you (because everyone should be using a controller) is very much cheating. When coupled with the standard “sticky aim” of aim assist (which is normal for all controller shooters), it’s pretty ridiculously overpowered. Xbox Game Studios OT IX Brought to you by Aaron.</p>
