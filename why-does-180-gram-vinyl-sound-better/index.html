<p>There is another side to the euphoria surrounding vinyl, particularly from music fans that simply view lps as an inferior format. The main reasons why vinyl records crack, pop and click are: If the sound is a bit dull and lifeless you’ve gone too heavy, while a thin or aggressive presentation means the tracking weight is a little too light. It came with a slight effort but did not compromise the hearing.</p>

<p>Whereas with black vinyl, you can run that on any press on any day, and while every record runs a little differently, you know the vinyl itself is going to be pretty consistent. Production mistakes, though exceedingly rare, can cause a vinyl record to become warped. 180 gram is a heavier grade of vinyl that many believe coaxes a richer audio palate than lighter, standard grades.

<p>Defeats the whole purpose of vinyl. I�d estimate that at least a third of the 40 or so new vinyl lps i�ve bought have had at least one off center side.

<p>180 gram is a heavier grade of vinyl that many believe coaxes a richer audio palate than lighter, standard grades. (warped, or bent, records can distort the music pressed upon them and cause the stylus to jump/skip.) This is most likely due to it being digitally remastered.

<p>In record mastering, the higher the recorded level and frequency, the greater the groove curvature. On the downside, however, an elliptical stylus wears down quicker than a conical stylus, while also requiring precise alignment so they are resting perfectly in the record’s groove. Early vinyl records could only store a limited amount of audio data because low frequencies and loud sounds take up so much room. Funkadelic Maggot Brain (180g) LP.</p>

<p>If the side is “long,” then the level will have to be lowered to accommodate the extra grooves.

The main points that were touched on throughout the article was the fact that vinyl has an overall better sound when playing the music, the process of listening to a vinyl is an overall better experience and has a much better aesthetic compared to when you are just listening to your music digitally. Early vinyl records could only store a limited amount of audio data because low frequencies and loud sounds take up so much room. In fact, vinyl records made on the same stamper, during the same production run also can vary in sound quality.</p>

There is another side to the euphoria surrounding vinyl, particularly from music fans that simply view lps as an inferior format. 180g vinyl sounds better than standard vinyl. 180 gram vinyl records are stronger and more durable, so they tend to last longer and resist breakage.</p>
