While this may be the case some of the time, in reality, there�s often other explanations. As moonlight passes through the ice crystals, it is bent in a way similar to light passing through a lens.

<p>No, a ring around the moon means that sunshine is coming, pirates used to thing that when rings are around the moon, a sunny day is coming, and sunny days did come from rings around moons. Since the moon isn�t as bright as the sun, the rings around the moon mostly appear white, while the rings around the much brighter sun more often display these rainbow colors. A ring around the sun or moon, according to legend, “indicates that rain or snow will be arriving shortly.” in high altitude cirrus or cirrostratus clouds with thin, wispy clouds, the ring, also known as the lunar halo, is created by light refraction and reflection from ice crystals floating in the clouds, which cause the ring to appear.

<p>“often you can look up during a clear night and see a bright ring around the moon. This phenomenon is called a “moon halo.” according to the national weather service, this ring of light, which is actually an optical illusion, forms around the moon when moonlight refracts off ice crystals in cirrus clouds, high up in the earth’s atmosphere.
