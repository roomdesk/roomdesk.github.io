XBOX 3604 comandos para gta v YouTube From youtube.com
I�ve been noticing the same issues lately and it all started when i played red dead 2 on my xbox one s then bought and played it on my ps4 (which is 4 years old) and damn did i see a difference in clarity on the ps4. Other than that, no huge improvements. Feeling like trading in my xbox one x for a ps4 right now so i could play classics like those games again meh : A 9 year old game designed for 12 year old hardware is gonna look blurry.
