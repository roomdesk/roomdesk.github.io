<p>So maybe at that time, xbox series x and ps5 won’t look as impressive compare to pc. I ask because i have a 1070pc, and would love for the xbox x to take over as truly my one place to play all games.

If you compare the specs to a pc you can build now (june 2020), on a price to performance ratio it’ll no doubt beat a pc you can build now, and it’d be pretty expensive to get a pc that can outperform an xbox series x (my estimate is about $1300 for a pc, and i doubt the new xbox will come in over $700).

<p>While the ps3 did move more units by a relatively small margin, i think the general consensus is definitely that the xbox 360 was the better console overall. This is exactly what the xbox series x offers: Couch gaming is more comfortable than sitting in front of a computer screen at a mouse and keyboard (i already do that 9 hours a day anyway!)
