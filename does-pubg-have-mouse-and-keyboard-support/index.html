Vivefox One Handed Mechanical Backlit Gaming Keyboard and From smmcrec.com
Pubg mobile might not have full controller support, but this extremely affordable gamepad is as close as it gets. There are times when i just dont have a proper setup to use a mouse and keyboard, and i love playing pubg on my xbox, so it works great on pc for me since im so used to it. Unfortunately, mouse and keyboard use is currently not supported on ps4 pubg. Im using a coolmaster devastator 2 keyboard and mouse set and it works 100% fine with cs:go h1z1 etc.
