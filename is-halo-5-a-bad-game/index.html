<p>The game play is alright, it felt too much like other games and not halo. It was inspired by r/lowsodiumhalo, (who we are partnered with), in a lot of ways. Halo 4, 5, and mcc, at launch were, for lack of a better word, terrible. Halo 5 Guardians review The Verge.</p>

I�ve been following the series since it�s launch on the og xbox and whilst halo 5 wasn�t the new halo story that i wanted, i still consider it to be amongst my favourite games of this generation.
