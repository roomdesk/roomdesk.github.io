<p>Theoretically, it would literally freeze him and his actual aging, so he could even be physically as much as 10 years younger than 49. That�s why i�m hoping that microsoft and 343 industries do the right thing and kill the master chief in halo infinite. You will receive cortana and bring her back here. 1000Toys Releases a New Master Chief Figure From Halo Infinite.</p>
<h3 id="the-banished-can-leave-or-die--master-chief-on-seemed-success-of-their-campaign">The Banished Can Leave Or Die. — Master Chief On Seemed Success Of Their Campaign.</h3><p>Everything he has gone through. Master chief stops the halo array from firing and battles through the wreckage of high charity to rescue cortana. 343i recently spoke in cryptic terms referring to halo infinite as the next 10 years of halo. It would have a too be a death literally worthy if everything he has done.</p>
<h3 id="the-long-periods-of-cryosleep-that-he-undergoes">The Long Periods Of Cryosleep That He Undergoes.</h3><p>While there�s always the possibility of a recovery of the true and benevolent cortana at the end of halo infinite instead of a defeat that leads to cortana�s death, putting a finality to cortana. Personally, i think master chief is the best super soldier ever created. Theoretically, it would literally freeze him and his actual aging, so he could even be physically as much as 10 years younger than 49. Winning battles, dying less, exploring the open environments, and using master chief�s equipment.</p>
<h3 id="if-master-chief-cant-do-it-then-they-will-order-spartan-locke-for-the-job-instead">If Master Chief Can’t Do It, Then They Will Order Spartan Locke For The Job Instead.</h3><p>And so, the halo wars—battles to control said weapons—began. Weather 343 likes it or not. You will receive cortana and bring her back here. So there you have it, biologically master chief is 49 years old, but his genetic mutations and time in cryosleep may have halted the process and have made him younger when it comes to his physical condition.</p>
<h3 id="the-master-chief-is-dead">The Master Chief Is Dead.</h3><p>The weapon will lock her down. At the very least we should get a flashback or fleeting exposition that explains the whereabouts and demise of cortana even if she has been killed off. But we are spartans, and we will never die!!! If you do not think you can do this… now is the time to step down.</p>
