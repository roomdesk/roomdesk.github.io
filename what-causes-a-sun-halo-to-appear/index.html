A halo is a ring or light that forms around the sun or moon as the sun or moon light refracts off ice crystals present in a thin veil of cirrus clouds.
SUMMER SUN HALO Around the northern hemisphere, sky From pinterest.com
Sundogs, light pillars, and other kinds of halos seen in the sky are atmospheric phenomena that occur when light is reflected or refracted by ice crystals in the atmosphere. This is an optical illusion created when low sun shines behind someone who is looking down into fog from a ridge atmospheric conditions throw the person�s shadow forward, creating an apparition. When these clouds pass in front of the sun, refraction and reflection of the light by the ice crystals can produce a halo. Recall that the atmosphere is a mix of gases , including oxygen, nitrogen and water vapor.

<p>In reality, it was the product of sunlight being refracted through hexagonal ice crystals high in the atmosphere. The most common (and smallest) halo forms at 22° around the sun, and hence is known as a 22° halo.

Sundogs, light pillars, and other kinds of halos seen in the sky are atmospheric phenomena that occur when light is reflected or refracted by ice crystals in the atmosphere. So, the question still remains, why do sun halos occur? Sun Halo / Vyhfn7hy Ddefm Likewise, the phenomenon may.</p>

<p>Lunar halos are actually caused by thin, wispy, cirrus and cirrostratus clouds and the refraction and reflection of moonlight by their ice crystals. There are also sun pillars where vertical beams of light appear to extend above and below a light source. Water droplets can do the same, producing a smaller but more colourful halo.
