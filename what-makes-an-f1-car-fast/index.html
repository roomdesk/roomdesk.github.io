<p>Illustration of bernoulli’s principle by misky noor (author) typically, downforce in an f1 car is adjusted depending on the race track. A formula 1 car’s aerodynamics glue the car to the road surface so much so that when a driver lifts off the throttle and coasts, it will slow down as fast as most sports cars can achieve at their extreme braking force. These can accelerate 0/100km/h in about three seconds. The long read Chasing 400km/h in the world’s fastest F1 car.</p>
