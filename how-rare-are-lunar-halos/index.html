<p>Moon halos occur when millions of tiny ice crystals in thin clouds high up in the earth�s atmosphere split and reflect the sun�s light bouncing off. Lunar halos are rare and can be seen anywhere where there’s very thin ice crystals on the air, so they are more usual on the polar regions. But only at the particular altitude of the moon when the camera fired does it touch both halos. Pin on Nature.</p>

<p>The halos you see are caused by both refraction, or splitting of light, and also by reflection, or glints of light from these ice crystals. But only at the particular altitude of the moon when the camera fired does it touch both halos. And so they usually form only rather fuzzy circular halos.
