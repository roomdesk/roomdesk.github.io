Can you use a keyboard and mouse to play Apex Legends on From quora.com
Hopefully they’re able to do that once cross platform play is available. See, apex legends fully supports crossplay multiplayer, which means that console players (controller users) can be matched against pc players (mouse and keyboard users, traditionally). Cause if they added it i am going to play the game forever no joke. It�s a strange new world where this morning�s video game news was discovered through tiktok.

<p>Using keyboard &amp; mouse against controller players is basically cheating given the advantage it gives. I absolutely don�t mind playing against pc players, in fact it makes sense since we would use the same input. The only time keyboard &amp; mouse support for consoles should be added is when they add crossplay, and even then it should only ever match you against other keyboard &amp; mouse using players on console or pc. I truly believe there should be an option for mouse and key usage in apex legends.</p>

<p>There’s cross play implemented which is amazing, but there’s a decent amount of pc players that can use a controller in game, so i feel like it would be fair if console had the option to as well.
