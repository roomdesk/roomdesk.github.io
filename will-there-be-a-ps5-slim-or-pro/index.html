Looking at things the ps5 is the biggest playstation as of now so if they made a ps5 pro/slim and made it smaller than the current one, i wouldn’t be surprised. While i think there will be an upgraded ps5 in the future i dont think a “slim” version is the one we will see, for one simple reason, heat. The ps4 pro debuted alongside the ps4 slim in 2016, three years after the ps4�s launch. On paper, the hardware isn�t as powerful as the xbox series x, so there�s wiggle room to roll out a beefier ps5 pro in a couple years too.
