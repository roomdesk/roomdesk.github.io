There is only one way to play halo 5 and it can only be played by one player. With halo 5, if you want to play with friends in real life, you’ll have to lug your xbox one console to a friend’s house and hook up your device — with your own halo 5. But pairing up with your friends in a lobby so you can play the same match takes a few extra steps. In addition, at least one person will need another console as well as two copies of halo 5 and xbox live gold in order to play halo 5 together.
