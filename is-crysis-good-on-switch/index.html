CRYSIS REMASTERED Switch Trailer (2020) HD U Watch From uwatch.in
Jokes aside a game from 2007 should run good on the switch, but it is crysis we are talking about. Even though it�s been thirteen years since the original release, the game still looks slick, marvelous and vivid. In conclusion i wholeheartedly recommend the crysis trilogy on switch. After successful ports of games like skyrim and the witcher 3, a game like crysis remastered should find a comfortable home within the switch�s lineup.
