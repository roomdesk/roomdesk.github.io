<p>While the compatibility is there, relatively few games actually support 120hz right now. Not so much 120hz 4k itself.

<p>120hz has the exact same input delay of 60hz. Still looks decent though, can�t really tell its not native resolution from a glance but it�s really stupid that the console doesn�t support 1440p.

<p>That doesn�t always bode well for movies or tv, but it works extremely well for games. If you�re getting a new tv its worth it to make sure it has 120hz, it looks amazingly better than 60hz.

<p>But is a 120hz tv really worth it for gaming? Get a 32inch 1440p@120hz or 4k@60hz monitor for work and a budget 4k 55inch tv for ps5. Ps5 is a console, pros for games aren’t really on here so there’s really no reason for games to shoot for 120fps right now. Running 120hz on PS5 in Crucible, worth it? CruciblePlaybook.</p>

<p>The ps5 supports 4k120hz so you should go for a 4k144hz monitor or an 1440p144hz.

<p>Is 4k 60hz good for ps5? The ps5 now supports the visuals of native 4k 120hz and 8k which the ps4 was 1080p. Sadly, there are known motion issues on this tv, particularly in game mode with 4k @ 120hz content. Is a 120Hz TV worth it for gaming on PS5? Android Central.</p>

Less than 1% of gamers on ps5 will care about getting 120fps. The same may apply to 4k since lg just released the 27gn950 which is 4k144hz. The rest just want 4k 60 fps on everything with ray tracing.</p>

Can you tell the difference between 2k and 4k? While the compatibility is there, relatively few games actually support 120hz right now. My brother plays on a 1440p 120hz monitor on ps5 and it doesn�t actually output 1440p, only 1080p.</p>

Still no confirmation whether 1440p will be supported. Don’t expect 120fps to be prominent until the generation after this one. And it will probably come a few days earlier.</p>
